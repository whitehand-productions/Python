  This is a place where I record all of my python projects. 


  1. iloveyou.py  - This is a Tkinter python program to remind everyone that they are loved. This is a sweet affirmation, and please pass on the message!
  
  2. binary_calc.py - This is a cli-based program that calculates binary operations.
  3. vent.py - Documentation of my thoughts and feelings regarding my self-esteem in a python program.
